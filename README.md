KivyMD is a collection of Material Design compliant widgets for use with [Kivy](http://kivy.org), a framework for cross-platform, touch-enabled graphical applications.

The project's goal is to approximate Google's [Material Design spec](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) as close as possible without sacrificing ease of use or application performance.

Currently we're in **alpha** status, so things are changing all the time and we cannot promise any kind of API stability. However it is safe to vendor now and make use of what's currently available; giving you freedom to upgrade when you're ready to do the necessary refactoring.

Just fork the project, branch out and submit a pull request when your patch is ready. If any changes are necessary, we'll guide you through the steps that need to be done via PR comments or access to your for may be requested to outright submit them.

If you wish to become a project developer (permission to create branches on the project without forking for easier collaboration), have at least one PR approved and ask for it. If you contribute regularly to the project the role may be offered to you without asking too.
